Algorithmic Trading System Overview

This document provides a complete overview of a proposed algorithmic trading system. The system will be built in Python, designed using object-oriented principles and using the best programming practices. It should follow the clean coding principles (readable, maintainable, single responsibility, …).

The system will have the following pillars. An additional document with complete specifications will be provided for each pillar.

Pillars

1.  	Data Manager – Allows the downloading, transforming, storing and accessing of market data from various sources.

2.  	TradingStrategy – Allows to define the behavior of a strategy through entry rules and exit rules.

3.  	Book – Allows the tracking of live and previously held positions, cash accounts and transaction costs.

4.  	Backtester – Allows for the historical replay of a trading strategy and the building of a book.

5.  	BookAnalyzer – Generates standardized reporting on several metrics, charts and interactive tools to understand the performance of a book.

6.  	LiveSystem – Leverages the Data Manager, Trading Strategy and Book to “execute” trades in real time.

The end goal of this project is to have a tool that would allow for the evaluation of a trading strategy’s performance, and, upon satisfactory performance, launch said strategy in a live system
